Sweetly Theme by [Owl4ce](https://github.com/owl4ce)
===========

This is a fork of the Sweetly Theme by Owl4ce, found in their dotfiles. This repo will track and incorporate upstream changes upon new releases. Some build files have been created and modified (by selene57) from paper-gtk-theme in order to allow package managers to use autotools to build this gtk theme. This repo can now be packaged, built, and successfully installed by the nix package manager (I would assume other package managers have everything they need as well, if not, please reach out to me so I can fix it.).

For rights and licensing please refer to the appropriate files located [here](https://github.com/owl4ce/dotfiles).
